    <h1>My name is Samuel VanDenburgh</h1>
    <p>I am a Computer Engineering Student and upcoming sophomore at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I am so excited to work with the rest of Work From Home Team 9 to create a meaningful project that will hopefully positively affect the lives of those greatly affected from the Covid-19 Pandemic.
